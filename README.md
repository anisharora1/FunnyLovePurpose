# FunnyLovePurpose
Intro: This project is based on a funny conversation between a girlfriend and boyfriend, where the girlfriend does not accept the boyfriend's proposal.

Description: In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JS, with JavaScript being the primary focus. I learned how to work with the addEventListener function, which allows multiple functions to be executed with a single click. Additionally, I learned how to store images in an array and how to access them.![Screenshot 2025-01-30 225459](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2adadceb-8eb2-47ea-9dab-35b5245d2250)
